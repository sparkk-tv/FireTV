# Sparkk TV for Fire TV

Sparkk TV uses the Youtube API to showcase our webseries & web-movies. We have chosen Github to host our Fire TV app. The code seen here is the up-to-date code used for our app. Anyone is free to use the open source code for their own projects, but we ask that you do not use any of the Sparkk TV elements. These are copyright to Sparkk TV and it's show producers.
